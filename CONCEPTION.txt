CONCEPTION :

Here will be explained what we added to the basic program, and how it works.

First, we didn't modify any of the given architecture but created many extensions. We decided to keep the stage four state, and 
continue on implementing things directly there. We didn't create a new game after stage 4, it's simply "Enigme".

We wanted to base our game on the Harry Potter license, by recreating the three brothers tale, by Beedle the Bard.
Our fifth level is only dedicated to it. We have to gather the three Deathly Hallows in order to cross the bridge (close enough
from the real tale). 

In order to achieve this, we created our own map, using the given tools, and took quite some time to modify it (look at the trees, 
dying near Death). This map is separated in four distinct parts, three different enigmas, and a goal. 
The first one is an invisible labyrinthe, to get the Invisibility Cloak. 
The next one is simply pressing dots and using lever to get the Elder Wand.
The last one is more of a Harry Potter knowledge based enigma, where you have to understand that you need to be "close" to death to 
find the Resurrection Stone. 

We had to implement many little things, here is a list of them all :
	-A brand new map, nice and clean, using the given tools.

	-Boots of Speed, Gotta go fast !

	-Running, a new feature simply used by pressing a key after picking up the boots in the level 5. We shortened the animation 
	duration and ajusted the sprite to the modification.

	-Animation, we animated our player, but didn't have time to implement a Harry Potter sprite. We had to use a sprite sheet and 
	get every frame of animation mapped to our movement. This can be applied to any sprite sheet (just need to adapt the code a
	little if the size isn't 4*4), and any entity.

	-Health Points system, in order to solve the third enigma. We can either lose life by standing on a fire, or get it back 
	by buying a health potion. The health system is solely based on ints increasing or decreasing, to a max of 100 and min of 0.

	-The Harmful Class, a super Class for the objects that can harm the player (only one in this game yet, fire).

	-An economical system. You can pick up money (as much as you want) in Level4, then use this money to buy potions in Level5.
	(Just like the Health system, this economical system is based on ints increasing and decreasing. You need at least a certain
	amount to be able to buy a potion, and not have 100 health points too).

	-Gold and Life points are written on screen, we simply used TextGraphics, just like in the first step with the moving rock.

	-Our own sprite, originals, all drawn by Hadrien (just look at the details, it's really incredible) using a few tools.

	-The use of signs to explain some enigmas, you can read them by interacting with them, interactables.

	-Dialogs involving our NPC, the potion seller and Death. We created a new Class for them, While the dialogs are on screen, 
	your player can't move. We used booleans to verify if the dialogs were played, and then avoid movement.

	-New items, 3 HPCollectables, the Elder Wand, The Invisibility Cloak and the Resurrection Stone (collectables using signals).

	-The cake is a lie. Take this piece of cake to close the programm once you beat it.
