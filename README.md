# First game made using Java in 2018 at EPFL

Welcome to this Mini Projet 2, developped by Hadrien Gerard Ongaro and Augustin Bouveau.
We implemented many extensions, if you want to know more about them, read the Conception text document.

## To launch the game
In the play.java file, simply press the play button after putting :
	*final Game game = new Demo1();  for Demo1
	*final Game game = new Demo2();	 for Demo2
	*final Game game = new Enigme(); for Enigme, the "true" game.

## Controls :
	*Press L to interact with you environnement (the tile in front of you), to pick up things, talk to npc and maybe more.
	*Once you get hold of the Speed Boots, press S to enable the sprint.

## How to solve the levels :
We put the mandatory levels,
*Level1 -> Nothing to do

*Level2 -> Nothing special, just pickup the Apple

*Level3 -> Regular Level3, press all the dots by standing still on them (and admire the animation when
					being switched on), pick up the key, set the torch on fire or activate all levers except the 
					middle one, then stand still on the pressure plate, the rock will disapear for 3 seconds

*Level4 -> Nothing special, you can pick up money that will be useful for the rest

*Level5, "The three Brothers Tale" -> this one is a little harder. You need to pick up 3 items, 
					The Deathly Hallows, to become a master of death and cross the bridge. 
					1)The first one is the Invisibility Cloak, you will need to find your way in an invisible
					 Labyrinthe. Look at the Laby1.png (in folder /res from the archive, if needed, take a look 
					 at the behavior map) for the answer, use the little trees to help you.  
					2)Then head straight and pick up the Elder Wand, press all 4 buttons, then activate 2 of the 3
					levers (right and left) to earn it. (Easier than killing the previous owner, isn't it ?)
					3)Read the sign,"I open at the close". This means you need to experience a near death 
					experience in order to find the Resurrection Stone. Use the fire to get yourself low in life,
					then find the good stone (quite easy). 
					4)Then you shall be able to access the bridge and win !

That's it for this read me, thank you for playing this little game, we loved making it !
